PHP, MySQL

In this project, we take a static web page written in HTML and convert it to a dynamic web page using PHP. We will use MySQL for the database.

# 1 Task
Run the virtual server and set your file in for that directory.

Open the document you created in the HTML and CSS task with the header, body and footprint, and extract the elements that are changed to a separate file.

Make a link to the variables on your own in the separate document you created for navigation choice. The variable has a certain value and based on that value it loads the content you want to load.

# Example:

var $ menu = 1 - home page

var $ menu = 2 - News

var $ menu = 3 - Contact, ...

Take advantage of all the materials from the previous files and replicate HTML files in PHP. You are invited only the content that is provided by navigation.

#HINT:

Elements that change are: navigation, content, banner, ...
The elements used for navigation must be in the <nav> element and nested
